Random sample of 30,000 U.S. high-school students who had profiles on a well-known Social Networking Site (SNS) in 2006. 

Data sampled evenly across 4 high-school graduation years, 2006 through 2009.

Using an automated web-crawler the full text of the SNS profiles were extracted along with the following demographic variables: 

graduation year
age
gender
number of SNS friends.

From the top 500 words found on the students’ pages, 36 words were chosen to represent 5 categories of interests: extracurricular activities, fashion, romance, religion, and anti-social behavior. These 36 words contain terms such as “football, sexy, kissed, bible, shopping, death, and drugs.” The final dataset indicates the demographic variables for each person as well as the number of times each word appeared on each student’s profile.
